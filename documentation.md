## Customer Behavior Analysis

The `vision_api.py` file contains the `analyze_customer_behavior` function which uses Google Cloud Vision API to analyze in-store video footage. It identifies customer traffic patterns, demographics, and engagement with products.

```python
def analyze_customer_behavior(path):
    """Detects customer behavior in the file located in Google Cloud Storage or on the Web."""
    ...
```

## Privacy and Ethical Considerations

The `privacy_ethics.py` file contains the `anonymize_image` function which blurs faces in the image to protect privacy. It also contains the `handle_privacy_ethics` function which handles other privacy and ethical considerations.

```python
def anonymize_image(path):
    """Blurs faces in the image located in Google Cloud Storage or on the Web."""
    ...

def handle_privacy_ethics():
    """Handles privacy and ethical considerations."""
    ...
```

## Personalized Product Recommendations

The `product_recommendation.py` file contains the `get_prediction` function which predicts the product recommendation based on customer behavior. It also contains the `analyze_customer_behavior_for_recommendation` function which analyzes customer behavior and predicts product recommendation.

```python
def get_prediction(content, project_id, model_id):
    """Predicts the product recommendation based on customer behavior."""
    ...

def analyze_customer_behavior_for_recommendation(path):
    """Analyzes customer behavior and predicts product recommendation."""
    ...
```

## Inventory Management Optimization

The `inventory_management.py` file contains the `get_sales_data` function which fetches sales data from BigQuery. It also contains the `analyze_inventory` function which analyzes sales data and predicts optimal inventory levels.

```python
def get_sales_data(project_id, dataset_id, table_id):
    """Fetches sales data from BigQuery."""
    ...

def analyze_inventory(sales_data, project_id, model_id):
    """Analyzes sales data and predicts optimal inventory levels."""
    ...
```

## Real-Time Feedback Processing

The `feedback_processing.py` file contains the `analyze_sentiment` function which analyzes the sentiment in a string.

```python
def analyze_sentiment(text_content):
    """Analyzing Sentiment in a String"""
    ...
```

## Interactive Customer Experience Application

The `app_interface.py` file contains the code for creating a mobile app or kiosk interface using Google App Engine. It integrates the personalized recommendations and provides additional features like store maps or special offers.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from flask import Flask, render_template, request
...
```
